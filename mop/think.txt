            use:

        Composition for input fields - code reuse & save state
        Restore focus

        Use virtual DOM to patch
            https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom

  Performance:
      FastDom:  https://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom
      this._patches = [
      '1.2.3:atts'
      '1.2.3:'
      ]
      this._drawnOnce

  Think;
    - different types of triggers, not just string but watchers.
    - sort shouldChange when element is reactivated.
    - wrap for namespace

    Redraw mechanism:

        Explicit events
        Watch objects
        Compare
