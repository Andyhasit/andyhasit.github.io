  - different types of triggers, not just string but watchers.
  - sort shouldChange when element is reactivated.
  - wrap for namespace

  Redraw mechanism:

      Explicit events
      Watch objects
      Compare

Scopes.

Currently the only way to have actions is by placing them in the vm/app
this means that flush will be 

There is no binding.

This makes it a bit inefficient as the redraw trigger is propagated to the full app.

Options:
    retrospectively watch the elements
    keep track of elements and the boxes they are bound to, so that events


    trigger:
        onClick="mop.find(13422).addToDo()"
        find will either track the id, or climb up the tree and call the function on the component.
        Use code shortcuts.
