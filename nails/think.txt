        Use virtual DOM to patch
            https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom

  - different types of triggers, not just string but watchers.
  - sort shouldChange when element is reactivated.
  - wrap for namespace

  Redraw mechanism:

      Explicit events
      Watch objects
      Compare
