# Andyhasit's git page repo

This is my [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) repository.

I use it as a hosting space + rapid development platform for various front end apps.

### Rapid development cycle

1. All projects in one repo for easy access & lib reuse
2. Only use master branch
3. Edit locally
4. Install any index page to mobile by clicking "Add to homepage"
